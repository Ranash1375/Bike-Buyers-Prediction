# Bike-Buyers-Prediction
1. Visualized data analytically using ggplot2 package in R and determined outliers and correlation between
variables
2. Fit logistic regression and random forest models by MASS and randomForest libraries to predict
whether customers purchase a product or not
3. Used k-fold cross validation for tuning KS statistic as a probability threshold for logistic regression
and improved the performance of the model
4. Used caret library for hyperparameter tuning of the random forest model and improved the
prediction accuracy
